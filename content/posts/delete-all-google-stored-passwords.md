title: Delete all google stored passwords

---

I was trying to delete all the passwords stored in google at {{< exLink "Google passwords" "https://passwords.google.com" >}}, way too many to do manually!

Couldn’t find a solution online so here is my easy one:

*   Go to {{< exLink "Google passwords" "https://passwords.google.com" >}}, sign in to your account.
*   Open the development tools in your browser, usually with F12\. I’ve used Chrome.
*   Paste the following code in the console.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
// Gets all the elements to be clicked to delete the passwords.
var a = document.getElementsByClassName(“dga”)
// Click all the elements.
for(i=0; i < a.length; i++){a[i].click();}
{{< /highlight >}}
