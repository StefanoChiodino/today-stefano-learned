Monocots have parallel veins in their leafs, which usually means elongate leafs as well,  complexly arranged vascular system, fibrous roots, and floral parts usually in multiple of three. Dicots have a network of branching veins, a vascular system arranged in rings, a taproot system (a long main root), and floral parts usually arranged in multiple of four or five.</p>\n<p>Source: Coursera’s Understanding Plants - Part II: Fundamentals of Plant Biology Week 2\n2.1 Plant organs.</p>\n<p>URL: <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-biology/lecture/4927r/2-1-plant-organs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.coursera.org/learn/plant-biology/lecture/4927r/2-1-plant-organs</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/monocote-vs-dicot-plants","categorySlug":"/category/today-i-learned/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Monocote vs dicot plants","date":"2020-06-07T19:49:56.961Z","category":"Today I Learned"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Xylem are tubes that allows water and substances to go through a plant.
