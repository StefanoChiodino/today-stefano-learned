Make your text easier on the eyes. Use bullet points, white space, shorter sentences, margins, boldface, etc .</li>\n<li>Be smart: don’t try to sound smart. Avoid jargon.</li>\n<li>Be the authority: don’t use “I’m thinking”, “in my opinion”, etc.</li>\n<li>Scaffold well to write well. Structure you text in 3 phases: say what you want to say, say it, repeat it.</li>\n<li>One idea per paragraph</li>\n<li>Every paragraph should start with a strong sentence on the paragraph’s topic.</li>\n<li>Start with your purpose, not the motivation or justification for it.</li>\n<li>The text may become too mechanical after revising. Keep your “voice” in your document by reading it out loud.</li>\n<li>If you find duplicate sentences, cut out the negative sounding ones first.</li>\n<li>Grammar matters.</li>\n<li>Grammar - I vs me: use I if it’s a subject</li>\n<li>Attribute modifiers like adjectives need to one of the nouns. Make them adjacent.</li>\n<li>pronouns are words that take the place of nouns, like I, he, them. They refer to the closest antecedent noun.</li>\n<li>Think of the writing from your reader perspective</li>\n<li>Cut adjectives and adverbs; qualifiers and amplifiers; “in fact”, “possibly”, “generally”, etc</li>\n<li>Cut out generalities like “everyone knows”, they often include the words: all everybody, everywhere, etc. You may need to rewrite sentences to make them more specific if they include words like: some, somebody, etc.</li>\n<li>use an active voice: “Bob did X”, not “X was done by Bob”. Passive voice is longer, less clear, and less emphatic. But it’s acceptable in scientific papers because it sounds more impartial.</li>\n<li>Limit verbs “to be” and “to have”. Including forms is, am, are, were, was, will be, have, has, had, have been and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ref: <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Business Writing course on Coursera</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/business-writing-course-notes","categorySlug":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on Coursera Business Writing Course","date":"2020-10-22T12:40:34.773Z","category":null}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Writing","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":8,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/writing","nextPagePath":"/tag/writing/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["1796801393","251939775","401334301"]}
