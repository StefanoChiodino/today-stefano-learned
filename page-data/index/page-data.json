He proudly pointed out to me how they prefer to write arguments using the long version, like <code class=\"language-text\">--allow</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">-a</code>. This is to make it easier to understand the system, and thus maintaining it. It made so much sense: decrease the cognitive load, increase productivity.</p>\n<p>Then I started working for the NHS, the biggest employer in the UK, and 5th in the world, just after McDonald’s. Seems like in such a big company nobody has time to spell things out, and after more than a year I’m still struggling to catch up on some acronyms. I often come across acronyms that I never bothered or dared to ask about, and despite having developed a sense for that they represent, I still don’t know what they stand for.</p>\n<p>When writing code, good sense dictates you should call your variable <code class=\"language-text\">pageTitle</code>, rather than <code class=\"language-text\">pt</code>. So why is it ok to abbreviate <code class=\"language-text\">GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research</code> in a nested acronym to GDPPR?</p>\n<p>I took a business writing course recently, and one of the key points was that you have to write for your audience. Look, I get it. I review a lot of <code class=\"language-text\">merge requests</code>, and the temptation to call them <code class=\"language-text\">MR</code> is strong, but think about your audience.

It makes the other party feel in tune with yourself and push them to continue talking.</p>\n<p><strong>Pause</strong> 4 seconds, especially after a mirror, to let it sink in and force a reaction. This may lead to the other party disclose more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Labelling</strong> is the technique of describing how the other party feels. It helps clarify the matters, adds a chance for a pause, and shows that we are listening.</p>\n<p>Cheap negotiators want to hear yes. Good ones want to <strong>hear no</strong>, because when a party says no they feel they are in control.</p>\n<p>Put yourself in the other party’s place and <strong>understand</strong> their situation. You’ll know what to offer, and what you can ask.</p>\n<p><strong>Deadlines</strong> cut two ways. The pressure to make a deal is on any party ware of a deadline. If you have a deadline let the other party know.</p>\n<p>We are irrationality more concerned with losses than gains. Mention what the other party stands to lose.</p>\n<p>”<strong>Fair</strong>” is one of the strongest words. Use it to propose you are meeting the other party in the middle, or that they aren’t.</p>\n<p><strong>Frame</strong> the negotiation so that what you ask actually seems convenient. E.g. for a salary negotiation ask for a range where you wish to receive the lower bound.</p>\n<p>Always try to get <strong>non monetary incentives</strong>. This also shows that you have reached the limit of how much money you are willing to bargain. Use towards the end.</p>\n<p>Round numbers seem artificial and subject to bargain. We perceive <strong>precise numbers</strong> as elaborated and more sticky.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>open ended calibrated questions</strong> like “how am I supposed to do that?“. They start with how or what, deliver them with calm, and follow by a pause. Open ended means they need more than a yes or no answer. Calibrated means you need to adjust them to a particular scenario. These questions provoke a shift in the position of the other party, or at least more information. Instead of saying “don’t go!” say “what do you hope to achieve by going?“. “Why” almost always comes across as an accusation.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep <strong>emotions</strong> in check at all times. Make sure to pause. Understand that negotiation is about emotions as much as rationality. Keep the goal in sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Listening</strong> is being in control.</p>\n<p>A negotiator role is to establish what to do, how to do it, and make sure it’s done. For example lead from a verbal agreement to a contract, and from there to a payment.</p>\n<p><strong>Summarise</strong> the other party situation until you hear “that’s right”. If they say “you are right” then it means they feel you forced the plan on them. “I’ll try” indicates not enough buy-in. If you happen to hear these dive back in with calibrated questions until resolved.</p>\n<p>Be aware of decision killers as much as decision makers. Other stakeholders are sometimes not obvious, probe to get to know them.</p>\n<p>Self esteem, pride, images, etc are often as important as money. Remember <strong>it’s not a rational process</strong>.</p>\n<p>Use the other party’s name but not too much. Also use your own name if possible. It all makes it more relatable.</p>\n<p>Say “no” without using the word, with phrases like “how am I supposed to do that?”, “your offer is very generous, I’m sorry that just doesn’t work for me”, “I’m sorry but I’m afraid I can’t do that”, and “I’m sorry, no”. “No” should have a gentle downward inflection to not sound aggressive.</p>\n<p>Going in a negotiation set limits and work within those. <strong>Never get angry</strong>, even tho sounding a bit angry can be beneficial at times, but often comes across fake. Never consider the other party the problem: <strong>the negotiation is the problem</strong>.</p>\n<p>Follow the <strong>Ackerman model</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set your target price (your goal).</li>\n<li>Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.</li>\n<li>Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).</li>\n<li>Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.</li>\n<li>When calculating the final amount, use precise, non round numbers, it gives the number credibility and weight.</li>\n<li>On your final number, throw in a non monetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Black swans</strong> are events you thought were impossible, and never consider.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/notes-on-boo-never-split-the-difference","categorySlug":"/category/books/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on book Never Split the Difference","date":"2020-10-23T21:36:25.845Z","category":"Books"}}},{"node":{"html":"<ul>\n<li>Clarity above all.</li>\n<li>Don’t waste the reader’s time. “If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter” - Blaise Pascal.</li>\n<li>The look makes a difference.
