  Xylem are tubes that allows water and substances to go through a plant. They
  are made of cells that die through apoptosis (programmed cell death). This
  process thickens the side walls, remove the top and bottom ones, and
  progressively kills the cell, leaving a tube of all those cell walls in their
  place.
