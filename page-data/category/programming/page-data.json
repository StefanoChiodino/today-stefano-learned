This looks crazy syntactically, but still easier than an <code class=\"language-text\">in</code> operator in bash…\nYou’ll need one line to test for each case you may have used like “EmailOne”, “emailone”, “emailTwo”, etc, depending on how you tend to type this.</p>\n<p>Force push after this is done.
