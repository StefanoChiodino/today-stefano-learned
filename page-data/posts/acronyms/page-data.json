He proudly pointed out to me how they prefer to write arguments using the long version, like <code class=\"language-text\">--allow</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">-a</code>. This is to make it easier to understand the system, and thus maintaining it. It made so much sense: decrease the cognitive load, increase productivity.</p>\n<p>Then I started working for the NHS, the biggest employer in the UK, and 5th in the world, just after McDonald’s. Seems like in such a big company nobody has time to spell things out, and after more than a year I’m still struggling to catch up on some acronyms. I often come across acronyms that I never bothered or dared to ask about, and despite having developed a sense for that they represent, I still don’t know what they stand for.</p>\n<p>When writing code, good sense dictates you should call your variable <code class=\"language-text\">pageTitle</code>, rather than <code class=\"language-text\">pt</code>. So why is it ok to abbreviate <code class=\"language-text\">GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research</code> in a nested acronym to GDPPR?</p>\n<p>I took a business writing course recently, and one of the key points was that you have to write for your audience. Look, I get it. I review a lot of <code class=\"language-text\">merge requests</code>, and the temptation to call them <code class=\"language-text\">MR</code> is strong, but think about your audience. Are you in a group chat with your Product Owner and the New Starter?</p>\n<p>Use all the acronyms you are confident your colleagues know, when you are writing to them in private. Maximise understanding everywhere else.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/acronyms","tagSlugs":["/tag/programming/"],"categorySlug":"/category/programming/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-12-23T21:32:04.000Z","tags":["Programming"],"title":"Acronyms","category":"Programming"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/acronyms"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1796801393","251939775","401334301"]}
